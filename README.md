Login automation for facebook.com
This repo contains python program to automate login process into facebook.com
while used login detalis are read from an external file saved as Credentials (for Security).
Also I designed it to search for a particular channel on facebook, "Valorgi", stored in the variable; (search_text)
It's my little open source begginer project with Python and Selenium.
Further contribution to this body of Code, will be highly appreciated.
Also please be aware there are few latent bugs.
Happy Coding :)
